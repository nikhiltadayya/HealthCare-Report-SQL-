# 🏥 Healthcare Database SQL Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves performing **SQL-based analytical queries** on a healthcare database to derive operational, financial, and patient care insights. It demonstrates practical use of SQL for healthcare data management and reporting.

---

## 🗄️ Dataset Overview

The project uses a **relational database** with the following key tables:

* **patients**
* **appointments**
* **doctors**
* **prescriptions**
* **billing**

---

## 💻 SQL Analysis Summary

### ✅ 1. Medication Frequency and Total Dosage

Calculate how frequently each medication is prescribed along with total dosage:

```sql
select medication, count(*) as frequency, sum(cast(substring_index(dosage,"",1)as unsigned)) as total_dosage
from prescriptions
group by medication
order by frequency desc;
```

---

### ✅ 2. Appointment Frequency vs. Average Billing

Analyze the relationship between number of appointments per patient and their average billing amount:

```sql
select p.patient_id, count(a.appointment_id) as appointment_count, avg(b.amount) as avg_biling_amount
from patients p
left join appointments a on p.patient_id= a.patient_id
left join billing b on a.appointment_id= b.appointment_id
group by p.patient_id;
```

---

### ✅ 3. Monthly Payment Status Report

Check **payment status trends over time** for revenue monitoring:

```sql
select date_format(payment_date, "%Y-%m") AS month, status, count(*) as count
from billing
group by month, status
order by month, status;
```

---

### ✅ 4. Unpaid Bills Analysis

Find patients with highest unpaid bills for financial follow-up:

```sql
select p.patient_id, p.first_name, p.last_name, sum(b.amount) as total_unpaid 
from patients p
join appointments a on p.patient_id = a.patient_id
join billing b on a.appointment_id=b.appointment_id
where b.status="pending"
group by p.patient_id, p.first_name, p.last_name
order by total_unpaid desc;
```

---

### ✅ 5. Doctor Appointment Counts

Determine each doctor’s workload:

```sql
select d.doctor_id, d.first_name, d.last_name, count(a.appointment_id) as number_of_appointments
from doctors d
left join appointments a on d.doctor_id= a.doctor_Id
group by d.doctor_id, d.first_name, d.last_name;
```

---

### ✅ 6. Daily Appointment Counts

Check **day-wise appointment volume** for operational scheduling:

```sql
select appointment_date, count(*) as appointment_count
from appointments
group by appointment_date;
```

---

### ✅ 7. Patients Without Appointments

Identify patients not scheduled for any appointment for outreach initiatives:

```sql
select p.patient_id, p.first_name, p.last_name
from patients p
left join appointments a on p.patient_id= a.patient_id
where a.appointment_id is null;
```

---

### ✅ 8. Appointments Without Billing Records

List appointments missing billing entries to ensure **data integrity**:

```sql
select a.appointment_id, a.patient_id, a.doctor_id, a.appointment_date
from appointments a
left join billing b on a.appointment_id=b.appointment_id
where b.billing_id is null;
```
